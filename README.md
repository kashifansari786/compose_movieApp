This application is built using the latest technologies and architectural patterns, making it modern and efficient. Let's break down some of the key features and components you've mentioned:

**Kotlin Compose:** By leveraging Kotlin Compose, your UI code is concise, reactive, and allows for easy composition of UI elements. It enables a declarative way of building UI, which can lead to improved developer productivity and better UI performance.

**Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection:** Using Dagger Hilt simplifies the process of dependency injection in your application. It helps manage the creation and setup of objects and their dependencies, promoting modularity and testability in your codebase.

**COIL for Image Fetching:** COIL is a lightweight Kotlin-first image loading library for Android that prioritizes simplicity, performance, and modern Kotlin idioms. By integrating COIL, your application can efficiently fetch and display images, enhancing the user experience.

**MVVM Architecture:** Adopting the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture promotes separation of concerns and enhances maintainability and testability of your code. The model represents the data and business logic, the view displays the UI, and the view model acts as a mediator between the model and the view, handling user interactions and updating the UI accordingly.

**Main Page with Movie List:** The main page of your application displays a list of movies, providing users with a visually appealing and interactive way to browse through available content. Utilizing Kotlin Compose, you can create a dynamic and responsive UI that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

**Detail Page for Movie Details:** When users click on a movie in the list, they are taken to a detail page that provides more information about the selected movie. This detail page can include additional details such as synopsis, cast, ratings, and trailers, enhancing the user's understanding and engagement with the movie.


Implementing caching mechanisms to optimize image loading and reduce network requests.
Adding support for pagination to efficiently handle large datasets and improve app performance.
Incorporating animations and transitions to enhance the overall user experience and make the UI more engaging.
Implementing error handling and graceful degradation to provide a seamless experience even in adverse conditions such as network failures.
Conducting usability testing and gathering user feedback to iteratively improve the UI/UX design and address any pain points or usability issues.
